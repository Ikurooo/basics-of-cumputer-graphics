# Basics of Computer Graphics

This repository contains code and materials related to the basics of computer graphics. The project is organized into the following directories:

## Basics

- `datastructures.ipynb` and `datastructures.py`: Implementation of basic data structures.
- `images`: Folder containing image-related code and resources.
- `transformations.ipynb` and `transformations.py`: Implementation of basic transformations on images.
- `triangles.ipynb` and `triangles.py`: Implementation related to rendering triangles.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions.

## Cameras

- `0`: Subdirectory containing sample images.
- `cameras.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook related to camera functionality.
- `evc_env.yml`: YAML file specifying the environment configuration.
- `images`: Folder containing camera-related images.
- `GUI`: Folder containing graphical user interface (GUI) code for camera operations.

### GUI

- `cvl_icon.ico`: Icon file for the GUI.
- `gui_gamma_correction.py`: GUI implementation for gamma correction.
- `gui_gamma_histogram_clipping.py`: GUI implementation for gamma histogram clipping.
- `gui_shared.py`: Shared code for the GUI.
- `gui_white_balance.py`: GUI implementation for white balance.
- `ipython_helper.py`: Helper functions for IPython.
- `weiss.jpg`: Sample image. for when any GUI app is run as main

### Camera Operations

- `evc_black_level.py`: Implementation for black level adjustment.
- `evc_compute_binary.py`: Implementation for binary computation.
- `evc_demosaic.py`: Implementation for demosaicing.
- `evc_gamma_correction.py`: Implementation for gamma correction.
- `evc_histogram_clipping.py`: Implementation for histogram clipping.
- `evc_white_balance.py`: Implementation for white balance.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and materials provided in each directory. Refer to the respective notebooks and Python files for detailed explanations and implementations.

## Acknowledgments

- This project is part of the basics of computer graphics and serves as a learning resource.
- Contributions and improvements are welcome.

## NOTE for GUI and Camera
- On linux you may experience issues with PyQt6 so I recommend using windows to run those two
