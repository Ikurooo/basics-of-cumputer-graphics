    ### Yes, there is a reason for subtracting the blackLevel value from every pixel value in the output_image.
    # The blackLevel value represents the level below which the image sensor produces no signal,
    # resulting in a pure black image. However, due to the inherent noise in the image sensor, 
    # even when no signal is present, some small fluctuations in the signal can still be detected.
    # These fluctuations can cause a small offset or bias in the pixel values, resulting in a "dark current" 
    # that can manifest as a small amount of noise or a slightly elevated baseline level in the image.
    # Subtracting the blackLevel value from the pixel values effectively removes this bias,
    # bringing the true black level of the image down to zero. This can improve the contrast and overall quality
    # of the image by reducing the amount of noise and increasing the dynamic range.
    output_image = output_image - blackLevel

    # sets to zero any pixel value in the output_image that corresponds to a True value in the mask 
    output_image[mask] = 0         

    # rescales the pixel values to the range between 0 and 1
    output_image = output_image / (65535 - blackLevel)
    
    # return the processed image
    return output_image
